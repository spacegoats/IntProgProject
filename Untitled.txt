[PS4] - Looking for a friendly PvP third for ToO/competitive play/fun ( More Details Inside )

Hi there! My good friend and I are looking to fill our regular three man fireteam with someone! We play mainly PvP and we like to think we are pretty decent ( i.e. 10+ Lighthouse clears, i think, and recent K/D's are up near 2.0 ). We're looking to do well regularly in Trials and also are interested in matching up in some competitive sweaty matches.  
That said, we're not looking for some hardcore shotgun blinking crazy man. We want a friendly cooperative person who enjoys playing the game and likes to do well most of the time! We're super friendly and would prefer to have someone who likes to chat about the game, life or whatever else. We also like to drink and play sometimes and drunkenly kick some ass in other game modes just for fun. It's a game after all and we like to enjoy our time playing it.   

SO, just a quick recap: fun, friendly, skilled, can take criticism, can give criticism.  

---

**Requirements**:

- play a decent amount
- communication is KEY
- somewhat well skilled so we can challenge
- friendly, can take criticism and criticize back while still having fun
- be able to switch off and chill with us also and be buds!
- be willing to accept challenges such as “NLB only” etc.  

We'll expect to play a couple matches first just to see if we all gel and stuff all in fun though, not to see if your K/D is a 3.0 in the first 5 games. 

*If you feel like you fit into this and want some chill friends to kill in the crucible post a little tidbit of info here and we'll be in touch.*
